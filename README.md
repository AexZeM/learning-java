# I'm Learning Java

## About This Repository
I have a personal goal: **to develop a mod pack for Minecraft Java**.  
To achieve this, I’m learning the Java programming language step by step.  

This repository will serve as:
- An **archive** of my learning process.
- A **portfolio** showcasing the projects, exercises, and experiments I create while learning.
- A way to **track my progress** and see how my coding skills improve over time.

## Why Java?
Java is the core language behind Minecraft Java Edition mods.  
By understanding Java’s basics and advanced features, I can create custom gameplay mechanics, tools, and features for the game.

## What You'll Find Here If You Check Out?
- Small Java exercises and projects.
- Practice code to strengthen my programming logic.
- Larger projects aimed toward building my **Minecraft Java Mod Pack**.

## Final Goal
When my Java skills are solid enough, I’ll start developing the mod pack I’ve been dreaming of — and of course, it will be shared right here.
